To quote Julie Andrews, let's start at the very beginning...<br><br>

I was born in a small town in India and lived there until the age of 12. We moved to Mumbai, India in 1981 and that's where I completed my first level of education - elemantary school, junior college, a Bachelor of Arts in Economics, and certification in Film Production.<br><br>

My first official job was with a film production company. Unfortuantely, the company was so new that they didn't yet have a client. They didn't get one until 6 months later, by which time I was quite disillusioned with the whole idea.<br><br>

A new position opened up at a publishing company and I was accepted for the role of a Space Marketeer. This was a glorified name for an advertising salesperson. I couldn't quite get my head around the idea of selling, especially when I relaized that a sort of quid pro quo was being set up between the newspaper publisher and the advertiser.
