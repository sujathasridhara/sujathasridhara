        <strong>April's Day</strong><br><br>

        April was angry! No one wanted her around. “You are such a wet blanket,” said the sun. 
        “I’m not!” whined April. “When you come around everything is dripping wet. 
        We feel like we are drowning,“ complained the birds.<br><br>
        
        April went to bed without supper. She thought very hard about what she could do. 
        She wanted to take revenge on the sun and the birds. 
        She started to devise a plan to show people that she should be appreciated.<br><br>
        
        The next day began with dark clouds covering the sun. There was a chilly breeze. 
        “Oh no! It’s April again. I wish she would give us some peace,” cried the birds. 
        Suddenly, big wet flakes started falling from the sky. 
        “How could this be? March was done. How come he’s still here?” the sun wondered from behind the clouds.<br><br>
        
        The snow did not stop falling. Before long, there were big piles of snow everywhere and people couldn’t drive anywhere. 
        There were accidents all over the place. April grinned, “See how you like that!”<br><br>
        
        People soon began wishing for April, “April showers bring May flowers. 
        We need April rain and not March snow!” appealed the people. 
        The birds and the sun agreed. Everyone prayed for April to return.<br><br>
        
        April sat and wondered if she should prolong the misery for everyone. 
        She thought for a while and then laughed out loud. 
        “I got what I wanted and now I am pleased. Go away, March snow. 
        It’s time for some warm rain!” announced April cheerily. <br><br>
        
        Soon, it stopped snowing and the air became warmer. 
        The snow gave way to rain and everyone was pleased. 
        The birds twittered happily on their branches and the sun brightened in the sky!<br><br>
        
        April lay back down smiling wistfully at the gently falling rain!<br><br>
