              April was angry! No one wanted her around. “You are such a wet blanket,” said the sun. 
              “I’m not!” whined April. “When you come around everything is dripping wet. 
              We feel like we are drowning,“ complained the birds.<br><br>
              
              April went to bed without supper. She thought very hard about what she could do. 
              She wanted to take revenge on the sun and the birds.   
              She started to devise a plan to show people that she should be appreciated.<br><br>
              
              The next day began with dark clouds covering the sun. There was a chilly breeze. 
              “Oh no! It’s April again. I wish she would give us some peace,” cried the birds. 
              Suddenly, big wet flakes started falling from the sky. 
              “How could this be? March was done. How come he’s still here?” the sun wondered from behind the clouds.<br><br>
              
              The snow did not stop falling. Before long, there were big piles of snow everywhere and people couldn’t drive anywhere. 
              There were accidents all over the place. April grinned, “See how you like that!”<br><br>
              
              People soon began wishing for April, “April showers bring May flowers. 
              We need April rain and not March snow!” appealed the people. 
              The birds and the sun agreed. Everyone prayed for April to return.<br><br>
              
              April sat and wondered if she should prolong the misery for everyone. 
              She thought for a while and then laughed out loud. 
              “I got what I wanted and now I am pleased. Go away, March snow. 
              It’s time for some warm rain!” announced April cheerily. <br><br>
              
              Soon, it stopped snowing and the air became warmer. 
              The snow gave way to rain and everyone was pleased. 
              The birds twittered happily on their branches and the sun brightened in the sky!<br><br>
              
              April lay back down smiling wistfully at the gently falling rain!

              In the summer of 1994, I made a decision that changed the course of my life. I resigned from a job at a publishing company, which I had held for four years, to start an Event Management Company. I do not regret the decision, but I must confess I did not have a clue then about the way things would go, because it was hardly smooth sailing in the years that followed. The business is in my past now, and I am in a new country facing other challenges.<br><br>

              Let me take you back to a time when I was ready to conquer the world with my ideas and my imagined brilliance. The company was created in May 1994. Soon after I had registered it as a proprietorship I met someone who seemed to be as enthusiastic about this venture as me. So we changed the documentation and made the company a partnership holding. There were now two of us leading the parade. We were comfortable as partners sharing the responsibility of and jointly planning for events from start to finish.<br><br>
      
              It is difficult for me to explain what was right about the things we did and where we went wrong. From 1994 to 1998 we seemed to be on a roller coaster ride. The highs and lows were equally scary and mind numbing. The first series of events came in rapid succession and we were euphoric. Even before we had reached any significant milestone we felt we had "arrived." Then, suddenly, without notice, the tide turned. We had to vacate our office premises due to lack of funds and work from our individual homes. We were just six months into the business at that time. It seemed impossible that things would turn out so badly so quickly. Another two months passed without any business offers. We felt it was time to end this nightmare. The day we finally raised our arms in despair we received a phone call. It was such welcome news that our joy knew no bounds. We had just been awarded a significantly large project. The profits would guarantee our acquiring new office premises plus extra for personal spending.<br><br>
      
              You would think this was a fairy tale and what had just happened was the start to the happy ending. Unfortunately, we were so foolishly convinced too. It is amazing in retrospect to realize that we would go through the experience of that year in the exact same way for the next five years. So it would be no surprise to learn that we changed offices four times in those five years, stayed home for four months each year and were ready for the loony bin being completely befuddled by these experiences.<br><br>
      
              But more was yet to come. We had not yet experienced "The Event" that would be the last chapter in a story that made no sense then. However, it has great significance now in the background of my new self-knowledge.<br><br>
      
              In January 1998, the coaster carriage being at its peak then, we decided to expand the business and bring in a whole new batch of employees. Until then we had had only two employees fulfilling the company's basic needs of a receptionist and an errands boy. The new set was going to be responsible for generating more income and reaching out to clients we had not already covered.<br><br>
      
              We held meetings every day to discuss event concepts based on our knowledge of a certain client's products and services or company profile. We were seeking to cater to a specific need, as we understood it. One such meeting produced a gem of an idea. We drew up the draft of the concept. Soon we were ready to present the draft to our client. With much trepidation based on earlier rejections, we sought an appointment with the client. To our surprise, he readily agreed.<br><br>
      
              The meeting was successful in that the client demonstrated his eagerness at executing this "event." He directed us to return with a complete idea covering all aspects of the event from plan to execution with costs included. It took us two months to cover the ground on all the requirements for this project. It was an enormous task we had decided to undertake. For some inexplicable reason, we were confident of its successful outcome despite all the problems we knew we would encounter. We had been through too much to pretend that things would go like clockwork. Murphy's Law ("If something can go wrong, it will!") had become certain in our lives by then.<br><br>
      
              Finally, in June of 1998 we were given the go ahead. The project was to create "The World's Biggest Coffee Mug" for a coffee company and pitch it for an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records.<br><br>
      
              The giant Mug was to be unveiled for public viewing on August 14th, 1998 a day before India's independence day and it was to be on display for three following days. We had chosen to conduct the event in the garden of an old palace that had been converted functionally to an events' venue. We supposed that the majesty of "The World's Biggest Coffee Mug" set against the façade of the palace would be a media event in itself.<br><br>
      
              The giant ceramic Mug, with dimensions 20 feet high and 14 feet wide (diameter), 11-feet long handle distanced at 5 feet from the Mug's body, took 2 months to create and was made in a ceramics factory 20 miles away from the city center. This meant that transporting the Mug, when completed, to the event venue would be quite a challenge. The making of the Mug was an intricate process involving burning, carving and molding. Forty-two men worked to create the Mug, and the final product was a sight to behold.<br><br>
       
              It was decided that the Mug would be moved on the 12th night, giving us time to handle any last minute problems at the venue. We had hired a large trailer to accommodate the size of the Mug and a crane to lift it onto the trailer. The Mug was to be moved in the middle of the night so that traffic would not be held up on our account.<br><br>
               
              The procedure began almost like delicate surgery at midnight. Ropes had been tied across the Mug in a crosspatch pattern to secure the Mug while it was being hauled up. The crane was positioned to lift the Mug, and its hook was readied to link through the ropes. Suddenly the crane slipped off the road and sank in a ditch that bordered it. A hundred eyes whipped across the road in shock at the sound. A hush fell over the 50 people assembled. Then they all heaved a collective sigh of relief. The Mug was safe!<br><br>
               
              The driver of the crane now had to haul his own crane out. The worst part of it was that he needed another crane for it. After hurried phone calls and tough negotiations, another crane was arranged, but it would not be available until the night after. We were in a panic about our client's response. Thankfully, the client's representatives, who had assembled at the factory to oversee the transportation of the Mug, said that they would handle the task of explaining the situation to the client. One matter was settled for the moment at least.<br><br>
               
              The whole of next day was spent in getting the venue organized and it’s décor set up for the event. It was midnight again, and this time the Mug just had to be moved. We had used up our buffer time. We were quite astonished to see that this time the new crane did its job effortlessly and the Mug started its journey to the venue sitting snugly on the trailer cushioned with foam.<br><br>
               
              Along the way branches of trees were hacked to allow the top half of the Mug to go unscathed, power lines were disconnected with the connivance of the power authorities, and late night traffic was redirected. The trip from the factory to the venue, at a slow moving pace, took over 3 hours. There were two entrances to the venue. We entered through the back entrance. Imagine our relief and our surprise when we learnt that news photographers had been lurking near the front entrance of the palace awaiting our arrival. A lot of media hype had been generated by releasing teaser advertisements in the leading dailies of the city and country. Some newspapermen were eager to catch the first glimpse of this exciting "thing" we had suggested was being unveiled. This event was going to be bigger than we had imagined.<br><br>
               
              The Mug was supposed to be set on a large dais we had created, but as we started to set the Mug down we heard a snap. One of the ropes had come off. This was a precarious situation. It was time for a quick change of plan. The Mug was set on the ground instead in front of the dais. The ropes were untied and a veil was pulled across the Mug. Now all we have to do was wait.<br><br>
               
              The evening arrived at last! "The World's Biggest Coffee Mug" was unveiled in a carefully choreographed dance sequence. Light bulbs flashed all over the place and cameras rolled as my client and his representatives addressed the media. They announced that the Mug was being considered for the Guinness Book of World Records, and they praised us for our efforts in the successful completion of this project.<br><br>
               
              Finally, before we realized it, it was all over. Suddenly I started to shake with severe emotion. I reached for the nearest chair and sat down. Then I started to cry because out of the blue I felt that the whole experience was a huge waste. I was shocked at this thought. When I was done with crying, I looked at this giant Mug we had created and mentally rehashed the whole exercise we had undertaken.<br><br>
               
              Unexpectedly I was seeking answers within. Why do so many human beings desire fame and money? At that point, with a wonderful event to my credit and having spent five years seeking nothing else, suddenly I did not want either.<br><br>
               
              A month later I quit the business. Today, I know that if I had not gone through the emotional experiences of my business years I would not have gained the sensitivity to know myself. It was in creating a World Record for personal gain that I recognized my potential to do bigger things that would help others.

              When I was twelve years old, my father accepted a job transfer to a big city in India from a small town three hours away. My father and I came to the city, a month before we actually moved, to decide upon our future residence. We had to choose between an apartment in a colony close to my father's place of work and one in a building located in the center of the city. As we traveled from the railway station to the city’s center, observing the number of multistoried building-clusters along the way and the lack of space in general made me feel quite claustrophobic. Yet Bombay seemed more exciting than the town we were leaving behind!<br><br>
 
              The building we went to see used to be the summer palace of a king. The palatial structure, the turrets on its roof, the expanse of the front arch, the enormous oval lush green lawn (bordered with rose bushes) which spread across the entire length of the palace and the giant almond and fig trees at opposite ends of the entrance gate, were the sights that greeted me when I first visited 'Anand Bhavan' (which translated from Hindi means “Castle of Joy!”)<br><br>
               
              I gaped at the large building and its huge garden, amazed at the existence of such a place in a city that boasted a population of 12.5 million people, with a population density of 603 per/hectare. In contrast to the constricted quality of the rest of the city’s dwellings, I was standing in front of a building that seemed not to care about the world outside. It was a world unto itself. It was inviting and open and almost seemed to say, " Welcome home! Here, you won't complain about being hemmed in! Here, you can be anything you want to be and do anything you want to."<br><br>
               
              This building was located in an elite district, with the rich and the famous among our neighbors. The location was also in close proximity to my school (later college) and to all the shops, restaurants and ice-cream parlors for the rest of the family to ogle over. Of course, at that time, none of this registered. The only thing I could see in front of me was paradise. A sense of calm fell over me while I stood there at the gates, as though an unspoken choice had already been made which was in perfect harmony with my desires. I was not wrong, because my father in that instant confirmed that this was going to be our home from now on.<br><br>
               
              We were yet to see the rest of the building premises. I still had to be awed by a sight I will never forget. We walked down the road towards the rear of the building. I could hear a rush of wind and water and then it subsided. This rhythm of sound continued. I was wondering at its source when we turned the corner of the building and stopped in our tracks. We were staring at a wide blue sky and the Arabian Sea meeting at the horizon. My heart skipped a beat as I wrenched my hand from my father's clasp and ran towards the water. It was the most wonderful moment of my life watching the waves lash against the huge wall that protected the building from the force of the sea. I was thrilled beyond words, not only at what I was seeing just then, but knowing that I would see it everyday for the rest of my life.<br><br>
               
              Anand Bhavan had been converted from a king's palace to living quarters for government officers. Walls had been erected between large palace rooms to create apartments. Our apartment was half (lengthwise) the king's court hall and two adjacent rooms. Even the doors were ornate and carved. We were told they had not been changed since the king's time. A huge pillar, which we presumed, was one of the two in the king's court, stood in the center of the long hall. It divided the space for us until we added a wooden partition and some curtains. My bedroom window opened to the sea.<br><br>
               
              The sound of the waves crashing against the wall, the fresh sea breeze and the smell of the sea became an unconscious part of my life for many years after that. Wild geese flying across the setting sun or the rising moons were images I had read of, but never before experienced.<br><br>
               
              We even had a tennis court behind the building. Sometimes the sound of a tennis ball being lobbed back and forth in the middle of the night would wake me up in a shiver of excitement. From the first day we moved into the palace we heard stories of ghosts in the building. We were told of the wandering soul of a king who could not bring himself to leave behind his 'Castle of Joy' and of his lover who met him in secret. It was exciting, scary and perfectly in concert with the images that staying in an old palace would bring to mind. There were a number of hidden tunnels and pathways that had been sealed off inside the building, doors the apartment managers would not let us open, which some said led directly to the sea. Some thought that the king used these tunnels to escape an attack or for one of his trysts.<br><br>
               
              Between the sea and my bedroom window was the tennis court and beyond that was a 'sea bench' where my friends and I would sit for hours gazing across at the sea. The expanse of the sea matched the expanse of our dreams in things we would do 'one day' and the places we would visit, sailing across this sea. (A study of geography would have helped in modifying that list of places we would visit!) On the seabed, visible during low tide, sat a giant rock that we dubbed the ‘turtle rock’ because it was shaped as such. Turtle Rock became my friend and confidant whenever I was alone. I would cry to him and laugh with him. He shared my most intimate secrets, patiently heard out my inventory of likes and dislikes and seemed to be rooting for my hopes and dreams.<br><br>
               
              On Sunday mornings most of the parents in the building would play tennis while their children waited impatiently for them to give way to budding tennis champions. We would have volleyball matches in a court created on the right side of the tennis court where there was more open space. The swing set and the slide, to the left of the tennis court, were all time favorites, often sending children home with scraped knees crying for a Band-Aid, only to hurry back, hating to miss even a single moment of fun. Hide and seek games were never easy to win because there were so many places to hide. We had to in fact limit the area that we were going to play within, to keep it fair for the seeker.<br><br>
               
              Then there was our favorite tormentor, the building gardener, who would never cease to mutter expletives (under his breath when parents were around and aloud when we kids were by ourselves) because we might have shown the temerity to walk across his garden. On one occasion he even locked most of the kids in a tool shed for making bicycle tracks across his beloved lawn. There was also the building watchman who was the true source of all those ghost stories. He claimed he was a watchman from the king’s time. He did appear ancient to us at that time. He was also our dear friend.<br><br>
               
              Some of the other features of the building complex were a medical center, servants’ quarters and maintenance department. We had all our needs covered in and around this building.Anand Bhavan was the envy of friends and relatives who were as surprised as I had been to find so much land devoted to such a small group of people. To those who lived there it became matter of fact to have the conveniences and joys of the space and the location. In fact, I came to love the city for many reasons and that definitely included my residence. Many years later, when I moved to another city and lived in more compact surroundings I realized how lucky I had been. Without exaggeration, I can say that the happiest moments of my life were when I lived in Anand Bhavan!

              If anyone asked me about my home away from home I would tell them about the MOC. I have been going there for Trail Work for 5 years now, 8 months a year, 1 weekend every month. Yet every time I go there it is like I am seeing it for the first time.<br><br>
 
              This weekend was not the regular Trail Work weekend. We were there to demonstrate to the AMC our skills in trail maintenance. I got there at 6:00 p.m. After unpacking I walked down to Catfish pond to sit by the water. There I met two kids (5 and 11), their dad and their two dogs. The kids were wonderful. We talked and played together. They were splashing about in the water and enjoying every minute of it. The dogs stalked each other and then wildly chased after each other on the small sandy stretch beside the lake. The dad cut up some fruit and shared it with me.<br><br> 
               
              After a while, the kids convinced me to go canoeing with them. I was scared because I didn't know how to swim. However, the kids assured me they would take care of me. The 5 year old couldn't get over the fact that I was scared. He wanted to know why. Plus he told me, "But that's what's the life jacket is for!" So we went canoeing...They kept trying to tip the boat to freak me out. :) Soon their dad used a kayak to join us. We returned to the lake beach and I left them all there to go take a shower.<br><br>
               
              I returned to the trail workers cabin hoping the rest of the crew was there. There was no one in sight. So I ate my dinner and read a book. It was probably 9 p.m. by then. Before long I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up approx 2 hrs later...Still no one in sight. Now it had grown terribly dark outside. I knew all the cabins on our side were empty. Suddenly there was thunder and lightening outside and a storm blew by.<br><br>
               
              I was getting anxious wondering if I had got the dates wrong. I needed to use the privy but was nervous about walking by myself in the dark to the rest room which was atleast 100 feet away. There were rumors about bears in the area. So I sat on the couch for a bit longer. It must have been almost midnight when I gave up the hope that anybody was coming to the cabin. I was hearing all sorts of sounds by now both outside and inside the 16 bed 2 room cabin. I decided I couldn't waste energy being scared, so I crawled into my bunk and got ready to sleep. I had almost fallen asleep when I heard a car pull up outside. Finally, someone had arrived!<br><br>
               
              The trail crew leader and another crew member had come so late because of work problems. Anyway, they had arrived and I was a happy girl. We talked till 2 p.m. and then went to sleep. Awoke at 8:30 a.m. with the arrival of more crew members. We started work late by trail work standards...but it was only a dog and pony show as P (trail crew leader) reminded me.<br><br>
               
              The task at hand was building a bog bridge. We carried 2 six by sixes (4 feet each) and 4 four by fours (8 feet each) lumber to the work spot. We laid the 6 by 6 pieces at each end and put the 4 by 4s on top 1 1/2 inches apart. Then we brought out the drill gun. Now I am known as the power tool girl of the crowd. So it was my job to drill into the lumber which I proceeded to do after another crew member marked the spots. That done someone else hammered in the spikes. We were done with the bridge in just 1/2 an hour. We had made the 4 by 4s jutt out by two feet over the 6 by 6 end pieces. Unfortunately that made it unstable. So we took another 4 feet 6 by six and cut it in two to make 2 more end pieces. I got a chance to use a Skillman (I think!) saw to cut the wood. First time user! Boy was it scary when it kicked back a bit.<br><br>
               
              Once we got done hammering the additional pieces we had to move to phase two. We needed to find HUGE rocks that would be the steps to get on the bridges we had made on that trail. Some crew members found them and moved them a certain distance with straps. We had to then drag them to the spot we wanted or use a griphoist to move them further. We did both and moved 3 large rocks in total. It was hard work but very satisfying.<br><br>
               
              After work, around 4 p.m. we got busy making dinner. Two of us went to the A & P nearby to get some additonal food. On the way back, we decided to have some fun with the crew. We were going to pretend that the guy had left me behind in the store. So I hid near the privy while Q told his tale. P was immediately worried and told Q to go get me. He was kinda mad. Not as much as when he saw me come running out of the privy yelling "Gotcha!" So he promised to return the favor.<br><br>
               
              Meanwhile we learned that two bears had been spotted at the camp. One the lodge manager had seen and the other P had seen. So we were nervous. Around 11 p.m. the privy needed our attention again, so two of us (C and I) set off holding hands to stay safe. Ofcourse the brilliant women that we were we didn't take a flashlight, so we had to make our way in the dark. We managed to get there and back. While returning we were talking aloud about various things. Suddenly we heard a loud shriek and out jumped P from near the bushes. We yelled and ran...except in opposite directions...still holding hands...so all we ended up doing was run in place. It was hilarious!<br><br>
               
              After we stopped laughing we managed to get to bed and retire for the night. We worked more the next day...moving 2 of those 3 rocks. I left the place at 12: 45.<br><br>
               
              Everytime I come back I have another story to tell. There are so many stories from the MOC. One story will explain my trail work name. It is Twiggy...not because I am that thin...<br><br>
               
              This was probably in my third year. It was cold as heck and we needed some twigs for the fire. Someone asked me to get some. Foolish me thought there might be some restrictions on where I can get the twigs. So I asked..."Where do I get them from?" Of course, just outside our cabin were twigs lying all over the place! So they said..."From the twig store!" I was never laughed at so much. To cap it...at the end of the year party...P gifted me a bundle of TWIGS! :)

              On October 18, 1990, Doug Hann, a Caucasian student at Brown University, celebrated his 21st birthday, which should have been his initiation to adulthood. Instead, he regressed to childish behavior and spent the evening of his birthday, after consuming a good amount of alcohol, behaving in a boisterous and uncouth manner. He shouted out foul, offensive and derogatory words, initially at no one in particular and then at students from other races who confronted him in the college premises. In due course, for what was termed as “flagrant disrespect for the well-being of others and for being unreasonably disruptive of the University community,” Doug Hann was expelled from the University, and thereby, his name was introduced to the history books. This was the first expulsion from Brown University and also the first for violation of the new “hate speech” codes enacted across the country over the past few years.<br><br> 
 
              Though the departure of this student was openly welcomed by most of his peers, some did question its basis. They felt the decision of the University was against an important tenet of freedom and against the law of the land that is committed to Freedom of Speech. Additionally, there was criticism of the manner in which the President of the University, Vartan Gregorian, was explaining this expulsion. In his letters, distributed widely, the President claimed that the student was being expelled for his abusive actions and not just his words. However, the description of the student’s behavior in the school’s newspaper did not indicate any such action on the part of the student. In fact, it was stated that he did not do anything physical, merely shouted out his venom. Punishing someone for things said, as opposed to things done, would be a contradiction of the First Amendment. The event re-opened the debate on the extent to which Freedom of Speech can be exercised before individuals may face repercussions based on new “hate speech” codes enacted to promote tolerance.<br><br>
               
              Freedom of Speech is an essential and integral part of democracy. The United States Constitution protects this freedom: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” - First Amendment – (Religion and Expression)<br><br>
               
              Restriction of freedom is a paradox. Freedom means “the condition of being free of restraints.” Nevertheless, there are certain limits that need to be imposed on individual freedom, which is the key to retaining freedom for all. This is, therefore, the basis of all laws that govern human behavior in a “free” country. Interpretation of freedom laws, as enjoined in the Constitution, is the purview of the courts. However, people have their own understanding of freedom that they bring into play every day of their lives. The matter, thus, rests at reconciling an individual’s version with that of the courts. The question is whether Doug Hann crossed the legal line or the ethical one when he exercised his freedom of expression. In either case, it is often forgotten, or ignored, that law and ethics are about the rules of living and rules imply restriction. So, we must ask whether we ever experience genuine freedom.<br><br>
               
              True freedom is about being liberated from rigid ideas and making informed choices. As we live our lives and have various experiences, we start to have a better understanding of people as individuals, beyond their outer appearance. Doug Hann was only 21 years old when he was expelled from the University. The expulsion has probably affected his entire future adversely. To that extent, whether this was an early lesson in life for him or a severe punishment before he had even experienced life can be debated. Either way, Doug Hann must be forgiven for having the same misconception as the rest of us that living in a free country permits us to live without morals.

              In Shakespeare’s play Richard III, we can explore the question: Whose will operates in the world? Is it God’s will, the Devil’s will or that of an individual? Throughout the play, we hear references to both God and the Devil as the originators of events, and the individual described as the agent of one or the other. Richard in Act 1 Scene 1 Line 151 makes the first reference to God as he plots the usurpation of the throne, “…Clarence hath not another day to live, which done, God take King Edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in.” In this line, we see God’s responsibility relegated to taking care of the soul after death while the individual controls his own daily life.<br><br>
 
              Lady Anne makes the first reference to the Devil in the play in Act 1 Scene 2 Line 45 when she consoles herself and the hearse bearers for appearing fearful of and obeying Richard’s command to set down the corpses of the slain kings, “Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.” Before this in Line 35 Lady Anne declares Richard as the Devil’s agent, “What black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds?” While Anne curses Richard, sometimes calling him the Devil’s agent and sometimes the Devil himself, she pleads to God for His response to the Devil’s actions. This sets up God and the Devil as two adversaries in battle and the individual cursing (to invoke God’s power) and individual killing (demonstrating the Devil’s power) are their respective agents.<br><br>
               
              To some extent, in this play, there is a sense that some actions are considered the works of the Devil while others are that of God. If the actions of a person do not correspond to concern and care of others then those actions are thought of as the work of the devil. Lady Anne deems Richard as the devil because she sees his actions as lacking in humanity. “Villain, thou know’st no law of God nor man. No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.” (Act 1 Scene 2 Line 70) In Act 1 Scene 3 when Queen Margaret, the wife and mother of the slain kings, curses the York kings for their actions and lays out in detail the course of events that will destroy the York, we hear her beseech God to make the curses happen. “O God that seest it, do not suffer it.” (Act 1 Scene 3 Line 269). Yet, these curses appear to go against humanity then why are these curses not the Devil’s charge. Why would Richard appear the Devil’s spawn while Queen Margaret God’s child when both seek harm for others? Does it make a difference that Richard’s actions are born out of avariciousness, while Queen Margaret’s curses rise from a desire for revenge for her losses?<br><br>
               
              In Act 1 Scene 2 Line 117, Richard wonders whether God is accountable for the death of the kings equally as the executioner, “Is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, as blameful as the executioner?” If, as Richard says, God is responsible for the deaths of all, then Richard, in killing the kings, was acting as God’s agent and not the Devil’s. However, later in Line 222, Richard seems to believe that only the Devil is on his side, as he contemplates his suit to Lady Anne and questions her acceptance of it and how long that will last. “…Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me, and I no friends to back my suit withal but the plain devil and dissembling looks…” Further, in Act 1 Scene 3 Line 132, Richard appears to mock people’s belief in God when he evaluates his own actions. “…But then I sigh, and with a piece of scripture tell them that God bids us do good for evil; and thus I clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends, stol’n forth of Holy Writ, and seem a saint when most I play the devil.” By judging himself as “playing the devil,” Richard suggests that he knows that his actions are wrong, yet he must follow through with his plans which will bring him what he want, namely the crown.<br><br>
               
              Dorset, Queen Elizabeth’s son, reminds everyone of God’s overarching role in life events after King Edward’s death. “Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeased that you take with unthankfulness his doing. In common worldly things ‘tis called ungrateful with dull willingness to pay a debt, which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent.” (Act 2 Scene 2 Line 88.1) Further, citizens of the land, when discussing the turn of events and debating who would be the King’s successor, assign the final fate to God’s will. “All may be well, but if God sort it so,” (Act 2 Scene 3 Line 36) and “But leave it all to God.” (Act 2 Scene 3 Line 45) And later, Queen Elizabeth bemoans God’s action after she hears that her two young sons (the princes) have been killed in the Tower. “Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs and throw them in the entrails of the wolf? When dids’t though sleep, when such a deed was done?” Elizabeth does not appear to be questioning God’s power but rather his lack of mercy for her two young sons.<br><br>
               
              When viewing the success of Richard’s plans, there is a sense that the Devil’s Will or the Individual’s Will gained ascendancy over God’s Will, because how could Richard kill so many innocent people so easily? Why would God participate in the death of people considered blameless? Richard’s actions unfolded into events that followed the course that Queen Margaret had prophesized. When Queen Margaret cursed, was it the Devil or God who heard her? Were all the deaths justified in the light of the loss that Queen Margaret had suffered? Moreover, did God ordain these events? In Act 4 Scene 4 Queen Margaret spells out how each death that occurred matched her own loss and thus cancelled out that portion of her curse. The only thing left for God to do was to kill Richard and thus complete her prophecy. Queen Margaret in calling Richard, “hell’s black intelligencer” declares him the Devil’s agent. (Act 4 Scene 4 Line 71) This suggests that God is a righter of wrongs done by the individual who is an agent of the Devil. Punishing Richard with death for his actions would mean that God had won the battle.<br><br>
               
              Richard does not ignore God, but does not consider him as having control over his plans. Richard tries to use God as a token of his promise to Queen Elizabeth when trying to convince her that he would be a good suitor for her daughter. However, Queen Elizabeth shows Richard how he has broken faith with God with his deeds, stating that if he had feared God then he would not have done the things he had done. (Act 4 Scene 4 Line 308-317) In truth, Richard’s keeps faith only in himself and the devil for his success. Right in the beginning in Act 1 Scene 1 Line 30 he declares, “I am determined to prove a villain.” As the play unfolds, we see his villainy descending into something more dangerous and potent. Richard will not allow anything to stand in the way as he acquires power. The last hurdle in this quest is Richmond who threatens his kingship. Richard’s relentless forward movement comes to a temporary halt when he allows doubt to creep in. In questioning his previous actions, Richard sees the exercise of his individual will as setting him up for damnation because no soul will pity him after death for the wrongs he has done. Yet, he is unwilling to concede defeat and must fight Richmond. Here the God versus Devil fight comes to the fore as each army braces to meet the other in battle. Richmond mentions God six times in his oration calling Richard God’s enemy. He encourages them to remember that God is on their side, and therefore victory assured. Richard’s oration condemns Richmond as a vagabond and a rascal, and focuses on the fears and the personal dishonor his army would face if they lost the battle. One is calling for God’s Will to be displayed and the other is asking the Individual Will to be given strength. The ensuing battle and Richmond’s victory suggest that God won the war.<br><br>
               
              Richard in achieving many of his plans appears to have given voice to the individual will. The unfolding of events that led to the death of many innocents suggests that the Devil had a fair share of success, but Richmond’s victory, in the end, suggests that God’s Will is supreme, and ultimately, God’s Will operates in the world.

              Hamlet’s agitation is a potent emotion that is conveyed to us in the first moment of his introduction in Shakespeare’s play of the same name. We recognize his deep sorrow over the death of his father, the disgust with his mother’s marriage so soon after, and his anger at the turn of events. However, Hamlet believes that none of these external expressions of his feelings match his inner despair. “’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good-mother, nor customary suits of solemn black, nor windy suspiration of forced breath, no, not the fruitful river in the eye, nor the dejected haviour of the visage, together with all forms, moods, shows of grief that can denote me truly. These indeed ‘seem’, for they are actions that a man might play; but I have within which passeth show – These but the trappings and the suits of woe.” (1.2.76-86) This sense of a disconnect between the visible personality and invisible untouchable core of man is witnessed throughout the play.<br><br>
 
              When Hamlet is beckoned by the ghost and seeks to follow, his guardsmen try to persuade him otherwise. However, Hamlet tells his men that he is not afraid to lose his life and his soul cannot be harmed by the ghost, thus suggesting two parts to himself. “Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin’s fee, and for my soul, what can it do to that, being a thing immortal as itself?” (1.4.45-48) Earlier when Horatio is greeted by Barnardo with the question, “Say- what, is Horatio there?” Horatio replies, “A piece of him,” (1.1.16-17) implying that the external appearance of man is not the whole man.<br><br> 
               
              If we deem the externals of a man as his body and his behavior, then we see that a person is recognized and identified by these two features. However, throughout the play we hear references to how behavior may be modified to appear a certain way to the observers, which suggests that any identity can be adopted by an individual. When Hamlet learns of the nature of his father’s death he plans revenge and warns his men that if they see him behaving in a way that is different from what they have been used to, then they should not be concerned, nor reveal that they are aware of something about him. (1.5.171-181) However, will Hamlet’s changed demeanor appear as afflictions of the mind, a temporary madness, only because people have become used to seeing a certain kind of behavior from Hamlet, and therefore taken that to be his nature? This seems to come across from King Claudius’s words to RosenCratz and Guildenstern, “Something have you heard of Hamlet’s transformation – so I call it, since not th’exterior nor the inward man resembles what it was.” (2.2.4-7) Hamlet has always appeared a certain way to his observers, but is that behavior Hamlet, or just Hamlet’s behavior? The latter would mean that there is more to Hamlet than his behavior.<br><br>
               
              We also see a discussion about behavior and true nature in a speech by Polonius to his son Laertes. (1.3.55-81) When Laertes takes leave of Polonius before leaving for France, the latter gives him advice on how to conduct himself so as to leave the right impression on people he meets. However, in that same speech Polonius also tells Laertes to be true to himself. This speech gives us a model for behavior and then suggests that this behavior would naturally flow if one was true to oneself. “This above all – to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.” (1.3.78-80) What is the need to give these pointers to proper behavior unless Polonius believes that Laertes may be influenced to act wrongfully. If the true self will guide him to right action, what will tempt him to negative behavior? Here we see a suggestion that man’s actions can be influenced by inside and outside forces. According to Polonius, the inside forces will always be a positive influence. We also see the suggestion here that behavior and the self are connected and yet separated.<br><br>
               
              Behavior can be a pretense that belies the urges of the soul. When Hamlet prepares himself to meet his mother he cautions himself against revealing his true feelings about her actions. “O heart, lose not thy nature! Let not ever the soul of Nero enter this firm bosom. Let me be cruel, not unnatural. I will speak daggers to her, but use none. My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites – How in my words somever she be shent, to give them seals never my soul consent.” (3.3.363.367) Behavior can also be a departure from the soul’s promptings. Hamlet shows his mother how she has acted in a way that she herself, in her deepest core, does not accept as proper behavior. “Oh Hamlet, speak no more! Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul, and there I see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct.” (3.4.78-81) <br><br>
               
              Behavior can also be a product of repetition. In Hamlet’s advice to his mother to “assume a virtue if you have it not” (3.4.151) he is suggesting that one can pretend to be what one is not, and in stating that “for use almost can change the stamp of nature,” (3.4.151.10) he is suggesting that man’s nature can be changed if he acts a certain way repeatedly. Thus, if one keeps acting virtuously then one becomes virtuous. However, this contradicts Polonius’ contention that model behavior comes from the true self of man. <br><br>
               
              Hamlet is speaking of a process of becoming, while Polonius is speaking of a completed state of man. Are they speaking of the same aspect of man, or are there two parts to man? Is there a part of man, which is separate from his soul, that can be influenced by outside forces, and is that the part that governs behavior in man? If this is so, then Hamlet’s passions and Hamlet’s courage are the manifestations of these two parts.

              Many people believe that astrology is a fatalistic art that leaves no room for human free will. In this view, a person’s horoscope reveals their inflexible destiny, which they are bound to accept, for good or ill, with no choice in the matter. However, a deeper understanding of astrology reveals that it reinforces the concept of free will by giving us the tools to make intelligent choices, rather than blindly following the path of least resistance. When we voluntarily choose to control our actions and reactions, we can change the nature of our lives and become the masters of our own destinies.<br><br>
 
              <strong>What is astrology?</strong><br><br>
              
              According to popular astrology writer Linda Goodman, “Astrology is the study of man in relation to celestial bodies, or to be precise, the planets. It is a system of thought that attempts to show a relationship between man and all things.” Astrology explains how and why individuals react in a particular way to each other and to the events in their lives. Linda Goodman popularized astrology in modern times through her books, Linda Goodman’s Sun Signs and Linda Goodman’s Love Signs, along with other books that delved more deeply into the art and science of astrology and its meaning for man. In these books she discussed two approaches to the study of astrology: reading the potential character and personality traits of individuals and predicting the future.<br><br>
              
              Most people’s understanding of astrology is limited to the daily columns in newspapers and magazines, to which they refer for day-to-day predictions, and to Linda Goodman’s first two books, which they may read to know their basic character. However, astrology encompasses a lot more, as Linda Goodman revealed in her later books, Linda Goodman’s Star Signs, Linda Goodman’s Relationship Signs, and Gooberz.<br><br>
              
              To understand astrology, we must discuss karma, because karma is a major foundation of astrology. Karma, a concept held in Hinduism and Buddhism, is the idea that a person’s actions in this lifetime can perpetuate reincarnation and determine the nature of the person’s next existence. Astrologers believe that the human soul is enrolled in a spiritual classroom. Spiritual lessons, however, are not learned in one lifetime, and many successive lifetimes are necessary for spiritual liberation. Astrologers suggest that each soul chooses to be born into certain conditions and with a certain set of personality traits for certain lessons to be learned. Along with this, individuals’ actions in each previous lifetime will, to some extent, define the experiences that they will encounter in the next - although some actions don’t wait another lifetime for their effect. Karma demonstrates the long-term responsibility for one’s actions. Astrology helps us to understand these choices made by the soul for its present life. “Astrology may be symbolized as God’s Computer to make certain karmic patterns more clear, serving the necessary and useful purpose here of holding Earthlings and their Karma reliably and sensibly, in some order of efficiency…” says Goodman in Gooberz.<br><br>
              
              <strong>Planets and personality</strong><br><br>
              
              Astrology combines the art of psychology with the science of mathematics. Every individual’s birth chart, precisely calculated and intuitively interpreted, provides considerable information about him or her. Astrologers take the time of birth, date of birth, and place of birth to draw up the birth chart. A child’s cry at birth, his or her first breath, is the sign of life - the soul has adopted its chosen human form. This moment is recorded as the individual’s time of birth. The place of birth is important to ascertain the longitude and latitude of the location. The date of birth is required to determine the position of the planets on a given day. A formula is used to calculate the position of the Sun, Moon and planets at the individual’s exact time, date, and place of birth, and these positions are represented in a circular diagram called a horoscope or natal chart. The chart is divided into twelve equal parts, called houses. Each house corresponds to one of the twelve signs of the zodiac, depending on the time of birth, and each house governs a different area of one’s life - family, finance, relationships and so on. The planets influence the individual based on their position in the birth chart in terms of the signs and houses they are in, and in relation to each other through angular relationships called aspects.<br><br>
              
              Most people today can easily recognize their zodiac sign from their date of birth based on information in a book like Linda Goodman’s Sun Signs. What this means is that each person will know the sign the Sun was in when he or she was born. However, that does not explain traits that are completely different from the descriptions of a particular Sun sign. As Grant Lewi explained in Heaven Knows What, “It is not a matter of the Sun in Gemini that sets a person apart - but the Sun in Gemini with the Moon in Cancer…the Sun in opposition to Uranus and trine Jupiter…the Moon sextile Mars...”<br><br>
              
              In a birth chart, the beginning, or cusp, of the 1st house is called the Ascendant. The sign of this house defines the individual’s personality. The sign in which the Sun lies defines the individual’s basic character. The sign in which the Moon lies defines the individual’s emotional nature. These three signs provide an amazing amount of information about an individual. Add to this information the signs in which the other planets reside, and we get clues to the potential character and personality traits of an individual.<br><br>
              
              Apart from the Ascendant (personality), Sun sign (character), and Moon sign (emotional nature), astrologers are always concerned about the position of the planets Saturn and Jupiter in the birth chart. These two planets play significant roles in an individual’s life. Each luminary and planet personifies certain characteristics in an individual. As described on the astro.com web site, “Jupiter represents the search for individual meaning and purpose, optimism, hope and a sense of justice, faith, a basic philosophy of life, and the striving for spiritual growth and expansion. Saturn shows how we experience ’reality’, where we meet with resistance and discover our limitations. It represents the conscience and moral conviction, the laws and rules that we chose to obey. It also tells us about our powers of endurance and the ability to concentrate; it lends qualities like earnestness, caution and reserve.”<br><br>
              
              Saturn’s significance lies in the fact that it symbolizes karma. Astrologers describe Saturn’s influence in a person’s life as a disciplinary force that sometimes appears to be creating obstacles and delays. Jupiter is said to offset Saturn’s so-called negative influence by creating opportunities and bringing in optimism. The aspects that other planets form with Saturn define the nature of difficult situations that an individual will encounter in different areas of his or her life; likewise, the aspects with Jupiter will bring in a ray of hope where there appears to be none. Saturn is the presiding judge who evaluates your karma and determines what is deserved in turn. Saturn is in charge of maintaining order and rendering justice. Thus, analyzing Saturn’s position in a particular sign, house, and its aspects with other planets, will reveal in which area of life lies the individual’s most significant life lesson. <br><br>
              
              Saturn might seem forbidding, but really he is a friend in disguise. Saturn helps us strengthen our resolve to rise above our restrictions and find a way out through trust and faith in a force greater than human nature. He teaches us patience. He shows us that with discipline and order in our lives we can live happier and more constructive lives. It is easy for people to act irresponsibly unless they have to face the consequences of their actions. Often, people complain about the way they are treated by others while failing to observe their own behavior. We may have forgotten our actions, but Saturn is always keeping an eye on us.<br><br>
              
              The other significant planets include Mercury, which represents reason and rationality of thought, Venus, which gives us a sense of beauty, Mars, which represents the energy and drive of a person, Uranus, which stands for intuition, Neptune, which gives us the supersensory, and Pluto, which describes how we deal with power.<br><br>
              
              <strong>Interpreting the chart</strong><br><br>
              
              The location of the planets and luminaries on the birth chart are studied on two levels - their position in a sign and their house position. These positions provide information about influences in different areas of the person’s life. Additional insight is gained from study of the aspects formed between these planets and luminaries - conjunction when two planets or luminaries are close together in the same sign, trine when they are four signs apart, sextile when they are two signs apart, square when they are three signs apart, and opposition when they are six signs (180 degrees) away from each other. One can study aspects in one’s own chart and also between the charts of two individuals. Conjunctions, trines, or sextiles are harmonious aspects, while squares and oppositions are aspects of tension and conflict.<br><br>
              
              A particular planet rules each sign of the zodiac: Mars rules Aries, Venus rules Taurus and Libra, Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo, Moon rules Cancer, Sun rules Leo, Pluto rules Scorpio, Jupiter rules Sagittarius, Saturn rules Capricorn, Uranus rules Aquarius, and Neptune rules Pisces. <br><br>
              
              A particular sign rules each house in the chart. For instance, Venus rules the 7th house - the house of marriage and close partnerships, Pluto rules the 8th house - sometimes referred to as the house of death and taxes, Jupiter rules the 9th house - the house of the higher mind. It must be noted that while specific signs rule specific houses, in an individual’s birth chart another sign could be the lord of the house. This difference between the ruler and the lord of the house is very significant in Vedic or Indian astrology, although lords are not commonly used in Western astrology. If the lord and the ruler are harmonious, the issues governed by the house will be less problematic. <br><br>
              
              Lastly, a particular house governs a particular aspect of an individual’s life. As delineated in Linda Goodman’s Relationship Signs, they are: the 1st house (Ascendant) - the individual personality; 2nd house - values and possessions; 3rd house - communication; 4th house - roots and origins; 5th house - pleasure and creativity; 6th house - work and routine; 7th house - relationships; 8th house - loss and common property; 9th house - philosophies and far countries; 10th house (Midheaven) - occupation and calling; 11th house - friends and acquaintances; and 12th house - beyond the personal. <br><br>
              
              An astrologer analyzing a birth chart combines the information about the ruler of a house, the lord of the house, the relationship between the lord and the ruler, the planets in the house and in a particular sign, and the aspects that form between the planets. Thus, the analysis of a birth chart is quite an elaborate affair that requires intense study and long hours. <br><br>
              
              <strong>Does astrology contradict free will?</strong><br><br>
              
              Linda Goodman wrote in Gooberz, “Behavior may be analyzed accurately, yes…by astrology and this - the reading of potential character and personality traits is the true and helpful nucleus of this ancient art and science but as for the predictive portion of astrological study it is, even yet, sadly misunderstood by humans simply because it has been so grossly misinterpreted…If man and woman would learn…to govern the animal-human nature in them then each man and woman would be the powerful Master of his or her own Fate and Destiny…” <br><br>
              
              Astrology brings to light an individual’s personal nature, and the karmic trends in his or her life. Individuals are in continuous motion of action and reaction that stems from their personal nature. This personal nature is the individual’s perspective of the world; his or her values, beliefs, and ideas about how things should be. While not all actions are guided by personal nature, all reactions are. Individuals need to disassociate from their personal nature in action, and control their reactions. Right actions can change the course of an individual’s life. Right action requires right perception, without the biases of the personal nature. In From Mind to Super Mind, philosopher Rohit Mehta says, “Right Perception and Right Action are two sides of the same medallion-one cannot exist without the other.”<br><br>
              
              People with limited knowledge of astrology believe that it suggests life is predestined and that individuals’ actions cannot change anything. In Gooberz Linda Goodman acknowledges that most people “…fear and shun the art and science of astrology (because) they quite naturally think…that their future Destiny is entirely guided by the stars alone, therefore, if they can change nothing why fight against the tides of predestination?” However, astrologers explain why it is easy to predict the life of an individual, and why this does not contradict free will.<br><br>
              
              Knowing an individual’s personal nature gives astrologers the ability to predict his or her reaction to a situation. This reaction will have a consequence, which in turn will become another situation in the individual’s life. This is the nature of predestination that astrology discusses. However, as Linda Goodman emphasizes, if one can understand one’s personal nature, one can avoid reacting to some events and thereby avoid negative consequences. It is up to each individual to become aware of his or her personal nature and the way it interacts with other individuals, to understand the force of karma in his or her life, to avoid reacting reflexively to events and experiences of his or her life, and to act in this life with spiritual goals. Such deep self-awareness will eventually lead to enlightenment, and to the full realization that only when one understands one’s personal nature can one truly exercise free will. <br><br>
              
              Socrates said, “Know thyself.” The ancient Greeks believed that such self-knowledge was the most crucial human goal. To know oneself one must understand the workings of the mind. “For the unheard declarations of the mind, decide the noisy journeys of the feet” (Dr. Paul Brunton, The Hidden Teaching Beyond Yoga). Astrology is an effective tool in this process. Astrology can reveal hidden facets of us. In some ways it is akin to psychology in its purpose. In Grant Lewi’s popular Heaven Knows What, he declared himself “more concerned with astrology as the only real key to psychological understanding of self then with any of its other phases.” Like Linda Goodman and other modern astrologers, he believed that the basic principle of astrology is that man can choose to develop his good and constructive qualities, rather than to indulge his bad and destructive ones, and that he can choose his times for action and his times for inaction, rather than remain passive before the tides of circumstance. This to Lewi was Free Will in action.
