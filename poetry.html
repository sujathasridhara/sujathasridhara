        <strong>Our Continent Song</strong> <br>
        (Written by the students with teacher support)<br><br>
        
        Hello North America<br>
        Say goodnight to Asia<br>
        How cold is Antarctica?<br>
        How hot is South America?<br><br>
        
        What’s it like in Africa?<br>
        I’d love to see Australia<br>
        Australia is the best<br>
        And Europe is the next!<br><br>
        
        Sailing on the oceans<br>
        With dolphins and the whales<br>
        Pacific to the Indian<br>
        Maybe we’ll see some sails<br>br>
        
        Atlantic to the Arctic<br>
        We can’t believe it’s real<br>
        We’re following the long trails<br>
        Of the sharks and the seals<br><br>
        
        We’ve been to all the continents<br>
        And now we know our way<br>
        Together we will see the world<br>
        From the oceans to the bay<br><br>
        
        Together we will sing and learn<br>
        The song of continents<br>
        Then we will share it all<br>
        With our family and friends<br><br>

        <strong>The Plant Song</strong><br>
        (Sung to Fireworks by Katy Perry)<br><br>
        
        If you only knew what a plant could do<br>
        You would tell everyone<br>
        About the things you knew<br>
        If you only knew how the roots they hold<br>
        A plant in its place<br>
        And also stores its food<br><br>
        
        If you only knew of how those leaves can be<br>
        Oh so important for you and me<br>
        If you only knew what a stem can do<br>
        Hold up the leaves, the flowers, fruits too<br><br>
        
        If you know these things you'll see<br>
        What plants will do to live and breathe<br><br>
        
        Chorus<br><br>
        
        'cause baby that's how they work<br>
        All the parts have their quirks<br>
        Each one does its own own own<br>
        Thing to help the plant grow grow grow<br><br>
        
        Repeat Chorus<br><br>
        
        When the sun does shine then a plant will grow<br>
        But it will all begin with the seed you sow<br>
        While it's underground it will stay safe from cold<br>
        Protected by its leaf and by its coat<br><br>
        
        And when the seed comes out from below the ground<br>
        A seedling it’s called and will be found<br>
        And then it grows into a plant<br>
        Which makes more seeds to start ‘nother round<br><br>
        
        Of life that keeps the plants around<br>
        And gives us air to breathe somehow<br><br>
        
        Chorus<br><br>
        
        'cause baby that's how they work<br>
        All the parts have their quirks<br>
        Each one does its own own own<br>
        Thing to help the plant grow grow grow<br><br>

        <strong>Praise or Encourage</strong><br><br>

        Should I praise or encourage?<br>
        How do I know what's what?<br>
        Being told I'm really good,<br>
        Or what is it I'm good at?<br><br>
        
        Praise can make my head spin<br>
        With wonders at my prowess<br>
        But if I am encouraged<br>
        I start to understand the process<br><br>
        
        Of what it is I do that works<br>
        Or that which misses the mark<br>
        With praise all I ever know<br>
        Is if I am a "bright spark"!<br><br>
        
        When someone stops praising me<br>
        I wonder how I failed<br>
        To impress my praiser<br>
        And dropped so low in the scale<br><br><br>
        
        Am I no longer such a "good girl"?<br>
        Did I not do "great work!"?<br>
        Don't I have any "talent"?<br>
        Did I act like a jerk?<br><br>
        
        Now with encouragement<br>
        Here are the things I feel<br>
        Acceptance and self-confidence<br>
        The words I hear reveal<br><br>
        
        My effort will pay back in spades<br>
        Taking a risk is safe<br>
        Now I've learned<br>
        to set my goals<br>
        Beyond the limits of praise!<br><br>

        <strong>Excuses Excuses</strong><br><br>

        I know a little boy<br>
        Who always tells me why<br>
        He cannot finish his work<br>
        Or feels the need to cry<br><br>
         
        He peppers me with questions<br>
        He tells me he is quick<br>
        He wants to keep on talking<br>
        But I can see through all his tricks!<br><br>
         
        He uses many words<br>
        To tell me what he thinks<br>
        When I ask him to write them down<br>
        He does not want to, "It stinks!"<br><br>
         
        I hope to end this debate<br>
        And get him working very soon<br>
        Maybe I can get him to try<br>
        'Cause, "Darn it! It is June!"<br><br>

        <strong>Friendship</strong><br><br>
        
        Friendship is togetherness,<br>
        sharing thoughts and hope<br>
        It's in times of trouble, <br>
        that extra length of rope<br><br>
        
        Friendship is loyalty,<br>
        to every word you spoke<br>
        It's remembering promises, <br>
        which for others you broke<br><br>
        
        Friendship is the story, <br>
        of souls that reunite<br>
        Making memories for the morrow,<br> 
        sharing love that never dies<br><br>
        
        Friendship is a mystery, <br>
        to those who know not why<br>
        A friend will stand-by until the end,<br> 
        and never walk-on by<br><br>
        
        You don't come by often,<br>
        this kind of friend<br>
        But when you do you know,<br> 
        this friendship will never end.<br><br>

        <strong>Ask me not</strong><br><br>

        Ask me not to stay silent<br>
        When a friendship is at stake<br>
        To live in isolation<br>
        Would be a big mistake<br><br>
        
        Ask me not to forget you<br>
        'Cause memories make a life<br>
        Though I leave the past behind<br>
        I carry on the inner strife<br><br>
        
        Ask me not to move on<br>
        Though one day I know I will<br>
        I must walk towards the future<br>
        Who can truly stand still?<br><br>
        
        Ask me to be loyal, <br>
        to be faithful and true<br>
        Ask me to respect your silence<br> 
        And let you be you<br><br>
        
        Ask me to wait in patience<br>
        And cause you not such woe<br>
